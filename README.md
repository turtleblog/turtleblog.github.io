welcome! for anyone confused about the name: it's not really significant. a pun on my first email address, nothing more.

i've been thinking maybe a little too much about whether or not to do this blog at all, but i think for now i've settled on using it as a catalog primarily for thoughts and feelings and photos. i don't really want to dox myself so i won't include too many specific/identifying details. i also don't want this to take up too much headspace and definitely don't want to let it become an objective of what i do so i won't commit too much to it. most of all, though, if you're curious about what i'm actually doing on a daily basis please text me! or call! or FaceTime! my days are always better when i hear from you ðŸ˜Š

i'm using github because the setup is easy and i can store large files (photos) here (i think??), also it allows me to be very minimalist about it.

anyways: currently in austin, slept in the parking lot of a planet fitness last night (a _very_ weird feeling, but aside from being woken up from sirens a few times i actually slept okay) and am currently in one of the city's public libraries. ate some good tacos! next few nights will be actual campsites in the area. backpacking big bend this weekend.

would love to get some podcast/music/other auditory media recommendations. the 22-hour drive over was mostly ebene (somehow their schubert album never gets old), martin frost, dodie, iron & wine, esther perel, plastic pills, and silence. won't be driving that much in the near future but would love to explore some new stuff. also, books! tell me what to read.

some things i've been thinking about: anticapitalism as mental healthcare, what it looks like for me, permanence, freedom and its forms, how weird and out of my mind i feel, how to potentially adopt and logistically manage a cat while living in my car.

very tired but feeling good! more later, hopefully! thanks for reading! miss you all!
