### long overdue dump

so late, i know, been a little busy. at first i just really didn't have time or the frame of mind to sit down and write, then i realized i'd procrastinated for so long that writing this post with any sense of continuity from the last would be a hassle, then i thought, well, it sorta seems appropriate to let the blog go if what's happening now is just my life and not so much a "trip" anymore...

but now i'm here so i'm gonna post a bunch of photos : ) no time to edit so this is what u get

left off at white sands. unbelievable visual experiences here &mdash went to see the sunset every day i was around. super windy and out-of-this-world and sometimes it felt like i was in that scene in avatar where aang and zuko try to learn firebending from the old masters and they're engulfed in a tornado of rainbow fire

### big bend (4/17)

i think i spent like 6 hours on friday just sitting on the edge of the south rim. felt like the edge of the world. so vast the horizon just disappears. it's the sort of experience that transports your mind to a place so far away that it lies beyond your powers of recollection. my memory is struggling to do it anything close to justice as i write this now &mdash; it seems to live in that inaccessible part of my history where memory fails.

the afternoon before my trip i had a lovely encounter with another carlifer named mario. we shared my ready-made chicken tikka masala in the trailhead parking lot with the sun setting behind us. we talked about his experiences (a year wandering the east coast), my expectations, our relationships and past lives.  he taught me how to skateboard, i played some bach for him (poorly), he showed me his favorite edm, i introduced him to the concept of a string quartet and and just intonation. we closed our eyes and listened to ebene's somewhere over the rainbow and he gave me a scented stick of latin american wood to remember him by. very romantic.

i told him how happy i was to have met him, my first experience of the sort, and he said something like for someone like you, the first of many, i'm sure. an incredibly open-minded and warm person from whom i learned a lot. really a new experience and it made me smile.

i can feel myself finding my happiness, and it's a sort of joy that i've not quite felt before. there's something different about it that i'm still trying to dissect, but it's distinct, just a little bit, from the happiness that i've known. not just that it comes from a novel source, but the effect too, i think.

when i started on the trail the next morning i had this overwhelming feeling of gratitude for all the circumstances and people in my life that have made possible my current state of being, and that felt really good. whatever the opposite of regret is (is it gratitude? what _is_ regret?), i think that's what i felt. if you're reading this (or, if you're not reading this), thank you. ðŸ˜Š 

&mdash;

i've been surprised by how smoothly all of this has gone so far. i don't really consider myself a worrisome person (would i be doing this if i were?) but i had a number of fears going into this, thinking there'd be an initial adjustment period, for sure, during which i'd cry and want to go home. what's actually happened is perhaps the opposite, maybe a honeymoon period of some sort. will it end?

also, the prospect of fitting your entire life into a small suv might seem difficult but i've actually realized there are so many things i brought but don't need at all. why did i go to costco specifically to buy a 24-pack of the two _worst_ flavors of clif bars? why did i bring noise-cancelling headphones? why did i let my dad convince me that he needed to hook me up with an entire box of restaurant-grade disposable plastic gloves?

anyways, i'm in el paso now. white sands this week and wwoofing in gila next week! excited

&mdash;

oh also i randomly passed this leaving big bend and ???

about a mile down the road:

&mdash;

ALSO i realized there's no way to get updates on this blog other than by following the github repository which you need a github account for. sorry about that. maybe i'll try to build some sort of email notifications engine... or maybe it's better that it just exists, and if you feel curious, it's there, if not, it's not! :)


### a few photos from austin (4/13)

### hello!
![IMG_1775](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103443757/162840090-8b2a6e55-82fa-421c-a944-a22497d1dedd.JPG)

welcome! for anyone confused about the name: it's not really significant. a pun on my first email address, nothing more.

i've been thinking maybe a little too much about whether or not to do this blog at all, but i think for now i've settled on using it as a catalog primarily for thoughts and feelings and photos. i don't really want to dox myself so i won't include too many specific/identifying details. i also don't want this to take up too much headspace and definitely don't want to let it become an objective of what i do so i won't commit too much to it. most of all, though, if you're curious about what i'm actually doing on a daily basis please text me! or call! or FaceTime! my days are always better when i hear from you ðŸ˜Š

i'm using github because the setup is easy and i can store large files (photos) here (i think??), also it allows me to be very minimalist about it.

anyways: currently in austin, slept in the parking lot of a planet fitness last night (a _very_ weird feeling, but aside from being woken up from sirens a few times i actually slept okay) and am currently in one of the city's public libraries. ate some good tacos! next few nights will be actual campsites in the area. backpacking big bend this weekend.

would love to get some podcast/music/other auditory media recommendations. the 22-hour drive over was mostly ebene (somehow their schubert album never gets old), martin frost, dodie, iron & wine, esther perel, plastic pills, and silence. won't be driving that much in the near future but would love to explore some new stuff. also, books! tell me what to read.

some things i've been thinking about: anticapitalism as mental healthcare, what it looks like for me, permanence, freedom and its forms, how weird and out of my mind i feel, how to potentially adopt and logistically manage a cat while living in my car.

very tired but feeling good! more later, hopefully! thanks for reading! miss you all!
